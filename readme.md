##EET Stat Continuity
This mod provides for stat continuity for Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET) characters. Stat continuity means that a character will have the same stats in BG2 / ToB that they had at the end of BG1 / SoD. For example, if you gave Minsc a strength boost in BG1, that strength boost will be reflected when he joins your party in Irenicus' dungeon.

Before installing the mod, be sure to update scriptnames.tph to include the script names of any characters that are added to your playthrough by mods. The installer will then patch the necessary files to add stat continuity for the characters in scriptnames.tph.
